# Big-Containers

## Pre-Requisites
1. Create EC2 Instances

2. Configure inbound rules

3. HTTP from anywhere

4. Port 8000 from anywhere

5. Initialize the Swarm

6. SSH into manager1: $ docker-machine ssh manager1

## Docker Swarm Proper:

Run:

```
$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr MANAGER_IP
```


The swarm is now initialized and the node that MANAGER_IP belongs to is now a manager

To check swarm status:

```
docker node ls
```

Output should show details of the node that has been assigned as manager

Join as worker node or manager node

## Find out command on how to join swarm as a worker/manager node

For worker: docker swarm join-token worker
For manager: docker swarm join-token manager

The node will have joined the swarm

To add worker nodes to the swarm:

- SSH into worker1 instance
- Enter command generated by joining the swarm as a worker/manager
- Repeat for other instances

Check the nodes in the swarm, run:

``` 
docker node ls
```

Create services:

```
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml vote
```

Services that are created from this command:

- Vote_frontend
- Vote_backend
- Vote_default
- Vote_vote
- Vote_result

Verify stack deployment:

```
docker stack services vote
```
